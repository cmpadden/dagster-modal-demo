# dagster_modal_demo

This is a [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) project scaffolded with [`dagster project scaffold`](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/create-new-project).

## Getting started

First, install your Dagster code location as a Python package. By using the --editable flag, pip will install your Python package in ["editable mode"](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs) so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then, start the Dagster UI web server:

```bash
dagster dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the project.

## Demonstration

- Leveraging Modal's compute from Dagster
- Accessing Dagster `context` from Modal (e.g., Dagster partitions)
